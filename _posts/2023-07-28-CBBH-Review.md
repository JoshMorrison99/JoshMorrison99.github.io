# Motivation  
Before taking this exam, I had recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and had been actively involved in bug bounty hunting for about eight months. During this time, I found and successfully reported ten security vulnerabilities on HackerOne.  

I learned a great deal from bug bounty write-ups, YouTube videos, CTFs, university courses, and podcasts. My motivation for obtaining this certification was to take my bug bounty skills to the next level.  

# Review  
Since I had previously studied bug bounty hunting, I was already familiar with much of the course material. However, I still picked up valuable tips and tricks while deepening my understanding of web vulnerabilities. The most beneficial part of the course was the ability to read the material and then actively test it on a vulnerable target.  

The course is well-structured, beginning with foundational knowledge before diving into specific vulnerabilities. One of the things I appreciated most was the lack of unnecessary filler content—everything taught in the course is useful for bug bounty hunters. The exam is fair, and if you know the material, you shouldn’t struggle with it.  

# Tips  
- You will need to provide a well-documented report at the end of the exam. Take screenshots and notes as you work through the exam to avoid spending extra time re-exploiting the machine to get the necessary documentation.  
- Create a cheat sheet with key course material to quickly find the commands needed to exploit vulnerabilities or gain a foothold on the machine.
