My name is Josh, but I go by the alias shelled online. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and have been working in the field for two years as a threat researcher. I find most aspects of cybersecurity interesting, but my primary focus is on web-related vulnerabilities. This blog serves as a space to document and showcase my journey in cybersecurity â€” including my learning experiences, CTF writeups, bug bounty reports, and research into various areas of the field.
